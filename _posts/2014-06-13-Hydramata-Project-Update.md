## Project Changes and Next Steps
There have been a lot discussions within the Hydramata project recently about how best to optimize our process, team makeup, and technology. These discussions have resulted in a refined [Product Vision][1], [Updated Process][2], [Architectural Changes][3], [Roadmap of Implementation][4], and restructured development team(s). To achieve the first phase of our refined vision and architectural changes, we will be shrinking the implementation team for re-architecting Hydramata over the summer to a small team primarily at Notre Dame. We will then bring in developers from other project partners as necessary and spawn additional development teams once we emerge from the core refactor. More specifics on next steps and other project changes are below.

### Communication
Inspired by how Stanford engaged with the community for Spotlight, we will emulate their communication model to keep the community up to date with status updates and recorded demos.

### Next Steps

- Community Discussion of Design with Hydra committers
	- During a Hydra committers call within the next few weeks we will review the current architectural design to get feedback on possible changes, any possible ripple effects for Hydra (especially work that could feed into changes related to Fedora 4)
- While community discussions are happening, for the chance of a deliverable by October, 2014 at Hydra Connect 2
	- A small team at Notre Dame will form to begin immediately to work against the roadmap laid out here: https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/HYDRASIR-542
	- Goals for Hydra Connect 2 from the Roadmap document include:
		- Hydramata::Work will be complete
		- Hydramata::Workflow will be mostly implemented
		- Enough of Hydramata::Work and Hydramata::Workflow will be spliced into Curate to achieve a “demoable” state
	- Notre Dame will implement the 3 Amigos/Story Triage process that was approved by the 5 partners 
	- Smaller team will include at various times Dan Brubaker Horst (PO), Jeremy Friesen (Tech Lead), Chris DeLuca (Scrum master and QA), Banu Lakshminarayan (Dev), Rajesh Balekai (Dev), and UI dev (from separate ND web dev team)
	- SWARM: during core IR development we are leaving it open to expand team for SWARM activities based on availability of resources and progress of community discussions
	- Cincinnati and Indiana are hopeful to contribute to swarming given resource availability and progress of community discussions
	- Revisit team composition, parallel teams, etc. on conclusion of core IR development
	- Smaller Project Team (at Notre Dame) will model Stanford Spotlight communication process
	- Demos for the community (continue regular invitations of project partners to each sprint demo. Maybe record them for screencasts?)
		- Email Summaries of progress (also similar to Fedora 4)
		- Stories and tasks tracked in JIRA
- Continue bi-weekly calls PD/PO to make sure we have a scheduled time to follow up on progress (next call July 14, 2014)
