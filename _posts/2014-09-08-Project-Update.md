title: Hydramata Project Update
---
The [Works component of Hydramata][1] is progressing with the goal of having a presentable walkthrough at Hydra Connect 2. It’s feature scope and development status is [publicly viewable][2].

CurateND development priorities are dictated by a [“living” document][3] that you are welcome to peruse. This document links to JIRA tasks with further information. The JIRA instance is not open to the public as of this morning (2014-09-08). If you are interested in more detail [Dan][4] would be happy to provide it.

[Dan][4] will be available on Skype at this time (2:00–3:00 PM EST) every week if anyone would like to discuss project status.
