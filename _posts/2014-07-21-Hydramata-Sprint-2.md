# Hydramata Sprint 2 Update

Capacity was decreased in sprint two due to vacation and training for several members of the team.

## CurateND

Rajesh is continuing to work on replacing our [legacy ETD system][legacy] with CurateND.

## Hydramata

Jeremy is continuing to work on [Hydramata Works][hydramata-works].
The primary repo has been moved to the [ndlib github organization][ndlib].
The repository will be moved to the [hydramata github organization][hydramata] once its initial development is complete.

Jeremy has written a lot about what Hydramata is trying to accomplish:

- [Explaining the Suggested Structure][1]
- [Interacting with Fedora][2]
- [Translation Services for All the Things][3]
- [View Lookup for Work Type, Predicate Set, and Predicate][4]
- [Work Type and Predicate Definition][5]
- [Design and Development Goals][6]

Dan is drafting a document that articulates the differences in design philosophy between Hydramata and Hydra Head.
He is also revising the Hydramata “vision” document to address the feedback from the last PO/PD meeting.

### Roadmap Update

There is no change in which components are in progress since [our last update][roadmap].

### Issue Status

No SWARM issues have been prepared for the next sprint. The team at Notre Dame will continue ongoing development.
